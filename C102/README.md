# C102: Advanced C Concepts for Embedded Development

This module covers advanced C topics and techniques essential for embedded systems programming. Complete the C101 module first if you are new to C.

## Topics
1. Bit Manipulation (`bit_manipulation.c`)
2. Memory Management (`memory_management.c`)
3. Interrupts & Volatile (`interrupts_volatile.c`)
4. Preprocessor Directives (`preprocessor.c`)
5. Embedded I/O Simulation (`embedded_io.c`)
6. State Machines (`state_machine.c`)
7. Modular Programming (`modular_programming.c`, `module.h`, `module.c`)

Each `.c` file contains explanations and exercises. These topics are especially useful for embedded development.

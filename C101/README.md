# C101: Fundamentals of C Programming

This module covers the basics of C programming for students with C++ and Python experience. It prepares you for embedded development by building a strong foundation in C.

## Topics
1. Variables and Data Types (`variables.c`)
2. Functions and Scope (`functions.c`)
3. Standard Libraries (`libraries.c`)
4. Pointers (`pointers.c`)
5. Structs and Typedef (`structs.c`)
6. Input/Output (`io.c`)
7. Arrays and Strings (`arrays.c`)

Each `.c` file contains explanations and exercises. Start here before moving to the advanced topics in the `C102` module.

# C Crash Course for Embedded Development

Welcome! This crash course will help you quickly get up to speed with C programming fundamentals, focusing on topics essential for embedded systems. You already know C++ and Python, so we'll highlight differences and C-specific features.

## Course Outline

1. **Variables and Data Types** (`variables.c`)
2. **Functions and Scope** (`functions.c`)
3. **Standard Libraries** (`libraries.c`)
4. **Pointers** (`pointers.c`)
5. **Structs and Typedef** (`structs.c`)
6. **Input/Output** (`io.c`)
7. **Arrays and Strings** (`arrays.c`)

## 1. Variables and Data Types
- Learn about primitive types: `int`, `float`, `char`, etc.
- Understand variable declaration and initialization.
- Exercise: Declare and print different types of variables.

## 2. Functions and Scope
- Function declaration, definition, and calling.
- Scope of variables (local vs global).
- Exercise: Write a function to add two numbers.

## 3. Standard Libraries
- Using `#include` to access standard functions.
- Common libraries: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`, `math.h`.
- Exercise: Use `math.h` to calculate square roots.

## 4. Pointers
- What are pointers and why are they important in C?
- Declaring, assigning, and dereferencing pointers.
- Exercise: Swap two variables using pointers.

## 5. Structs and Typedef
- Defining and using structs.
- Using `typedef` for custom types.
- Exercise: Create a struct for a student and print its fields.

## 6. Input/Output
- Using `printf` and `scanf` for console I/O.
- Exercise: Read a number from the user and print its square.

## 7. Arrays and Strings
- Declaring and using arrays.
- Working with strings (character arrays).
- Exercise: Reverse a string.

Each section has a corresponding `.c` file with code snippets and exercises. Start with `variables.c` and work your way through. Happy coding!

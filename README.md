# EEE158 Crash Course in C Programming

Welcome to the C Crash Course! This repository is designed for college students transitioning to C, with a focus on embedded development. The course is split into two modules:

## Modules

- **C101**: Fundamentals of C Programming
- **C102**: Advanced C Concepts for Embedded Development

Each module contains a README and example `.c` files with explanations and exercises.

---

### Getting Started

1. Begin with the `C101` folder to learn C basics.
2. Move on to `C102` for advanced topics relevant to embedded systems.

---

### Folder Structure

- `C101/`: Variables, functions, libraries, pointers, structs, I/O, arrays
- `C102/`: Bit manipulation, memory management, interrupts, preprocessor, embedded I/O, state machines, modular programming
